# Movie Recommendation System - Capstone Project
Burak Karadurak and Åževval Arslan's capstone project.

We built a recommendation system that uses both collaborative filtering and content based recommendations. KNN is for collaborative filtering, ANN is for content based recommendations. We also created a interface with Flask so it will be easy to use this system.
